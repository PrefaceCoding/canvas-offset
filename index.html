		<p>Try and move the mouse around, and then try and see what happens if you shrink your browser.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Remember that your canvas was centered. The Canvas Top Left Coordinates should change when you shrink your browser, and that is because the coordinates are relative to the "viewport". The "center" changes as you shrink, and expand the browser.</p>
